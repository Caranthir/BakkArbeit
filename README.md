This Android Application was written for my Bachelor's Thesis at the Vienna University of Technology.
This App is a simple copy of "Google Drive" for photos. Every user has an account on the server.
1) The user connects to the server and logs in.
2) If there are existing files in the account, files in the account are automatically downloaded and restored on the device.
3) The user can also select photos from the device and add them to his/her account.

The app uses the first Design Pattern, that was introduced by Virgil Dobjanschi in Google I/O 2010 ("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHXn3Kg2IQE").
